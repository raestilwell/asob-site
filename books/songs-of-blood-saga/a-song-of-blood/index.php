					<h1>A Song of <span class="blood-text">Blood</span></h1>
					<h2>Book One of the Songs of Blood Saga</h2>
					
					<div class="text-center">
						<p><em>“I am, and have only ever been, a monster.”</em></p>
	
						<p><em>There was only one future he could give her, one withering curse that he could inflict, and no guarantee that her song would keep him alive, for her eternity.</em></p>
	
						<p><em>“You are not a monster, Lian, only a man.”</em></p>
					</div>

					<p>Cursed with immortality, vampire Arch Lord Lian Redmond exists within a gilded prison from which there is no escape. A bevy of stolen beauties adorns his castle garden, but none possess the song in their blood that will prevent his soul from withering into silence and darkness.</p>

					<p>Now, after one hundred years without a heart, he has found life in the unique song of a new Flower who has fallen at his feet. Will he dare to capture a final, perfect Rose for his immortal garden in the hope that this time, his soul might live to sing forever? Or will he resist his dark compulsions and accept the embrace of silence as his eternal destiny?</p>
					
					<p>Set in Regency England in the year 1810, A Song of Blood is a powerful love story that interweaves history with romance, fantasy, and the supernatural. As Lian and his cursed family navigate eternity searching for happiness, their course is marked by desire, treachery, and betrayal in the first tale of this epic saga.</p>
